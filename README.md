# Lane Detection using Hough Line Transform

This project demonstrates how to detect lanes on roads using computer vision techniques. By processing road images, the system identifies and highlights lanes accurately using methods like image preprocessing, edge detection, and algorithmic optimization.

## How to run on Google Colab
